# üó£Ô∏è Voice-Driven Data Analysis App with Python

This project is a voice-powered data analysis tool that allows users to interact with CSV and Excel data files using spoken commands. 
It is designed to simplify and enhance data exploration for both beginners and professionals by eliminating the need to type commands or code.
In addition I always wanted to be both a software engineer and a data analyst so it would be cool to combine both of these dreams into one project. 

Here are some features I incorporated to the Code.

- **Speech Recognition Input**: Use your voice to choose options instead of typing.
- **Data File Compatibility**: Supports `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
- **Sectioned Functionality**:
  - **Section 1**: Read and display full or partial data.
  - **Section 2**: Clean and manipulate data.
  - **Section 3**: Perform basic data analysis.
  - **Section 4**: Export cleaned or analyzed data to a new file.
- **Interactive Menu System**: Guides the user through options based on speech input.

- My next steps to enhance this project would definetly be able to incorporate SQL database handling since most companies use SQL to handle their data and data to client server relationships.
